# Practical Exercise 1
The goals of today's exercise are:

1) create a _GitHub_ account and link it with _RStudio_ and create a new repository 
2) getting you back into _R_ and to get you acquainted with _Python_
3) brushing up on the general linear model

# 1) Creating a _GitHub_ account and linking it to RStudio

## _GitHub_

Go to www.github.com and sign up if you aren't already  
![__Figure__: _GitHub_'s front page](images/github_front_page.png)  

If you are not already using personal tokens for authentication, have a look here:  
https://www.edgoad.com/2021/02/using-personal-access-tokens-with-git-and-github.html

Then install _R_ and _RStudio_ if you haven't already

## _R_

### Mac and Windows
_R_ can be downloaded and installed from https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/cran/ (Danish mirror)  

### Linux
Can also be installed from the link above, but it is more convenient to use your package manager, e.g.

![__Figure__: my package manager](images/package_manager.png)

### _RStudio_ (IDE: Integrated Development Editor)

_RStudio_ can be downloaded from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

## Link _GitHub_ and _RStudio_

Link your _GitHub_ account to _RStudio_ and create a repository for the assignments and practical exercises.  
Follow this tutorial: https://happygitwithr.com (Chapter 12)

# 2) Prepare your _R_ and _Python_ environments
Today's first goal is to get your _R_ and _Python_ environments up and running  

## _R_

### _R_ Packages

Make sure you can run _R Markdown_; create a new _R Markdown_ document - if you're asked to install extra packages, do so.  
We'll need more packages later, but we'll install as we go...

## _Python_

Due to the fact that _Python_ packages have a lot of interdependencies that may cause compability problems if you keep everything in one big environment, it is advisable to use a package management system like _Conda_.  
I propose using _Miniconda_ that can be downloaded from here: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html (choose 64-bit)  
  
We'll not do much with it today, but will return to it for the machine learning part.  
  
An advantage is that separate environments can be maintained that are each focused on its own niche:  

![__Figure__: my environments: _mne_ is for analysis of magnetoencephalographic data, _psychopy_ is for presenting experiment scenarios, _fsl_ is for processing magnetic resonance imaging data](images/list_of_environments.png)

Then use the yml-file from _GitHub_ to create the appropriate environment:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# CODE TO BE RUN IN A BASH TERMINAL
## create environment
conda env create -f methods3_environment.yml
## activate environment
conda activate methods3
## after activation, you can run Spyder, (IDE)
spyder


```

![__Figure__: _Spyder_](images/spyder.png)

### Check that it works

```{python}
a = 3+2
b = a + 3
print(b)

a_list = [1, 'a', 2.3] # square brackets initialize lists that can contain any combination of any type of object (an integer, a string and a float in this case)
## Note that Python is zero-indexed ()
print(a_list[0]) ## prints the first entry
print(a_list[1]) ## prints the second entry
```
### Zero-indexing (reference)

# 3) Brushing up on the General Linear Model

We'll do a light start and get you back in the game of thinking about formulae and how to build your linear models.
Finally, we'll have a few exercises, finishing off today's practical exercises 

## A list of formulae
```{r, eval=FALSE}
formula <- y ~ x ## y as a function of x

y ~ 1 ## model the intercept for "y"
y ~ x ## model the main effect of x and the intercept for y
y ~ x + 1 ## the same as above (+ 1 is implicit)
y ~ x + 0 ## model the main effect of x and no intercept
y ~ x - 1 ## the same as above
y ~ 0 ## doesn't model anything (for completeness)
y ~ x + z ## model the main effects x and z (and an intercept)
y ~ x:z ## model interaction of x and z
y ~ x * z ## model the main effects x and z and their interaction
y ~ x + z + x:z ## the same as above
```

## Dataset mtcars
Let's look at the "mtcars" data:  

_[, 1]   mpg   Miles/(US) gallon  
[, 2]	 cyl	 Number of cylinders  
[, 3]	 disp	 Displacement (cu.in.)  
[, 4]	 hp	 Gross horsepower  
[, 5]	 drat	 Rear axle ratio  
[, 6]	 wt	 Weight (lb/1000)  
[, 7]	 qsec	 1/4 mile time  
[, 8]	 vs	 V/S  
[, 9]	 am	 Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)  
[,10]	 gear	 Number of forward gears  
[,11]	 carb	 Number of carburetors_  


## Miles per gallon and weight

We can do a scatter plot, and it looks like there is some relation between fuel usage and the weight of cars.
Let's investigate this further

```{r,fig.height=5, fig.width=6}

par(font.lab=2, font.axis=2, cex=1.2)
plot(mpg ~ wt, data=mtcars, xlab='Weight (lb/1000)', ylab='Miles/(US) gallon',
     main='Scatter plot', ylim=c(0, 40))

```

# Exercises and objectives
The objectives of today's exercises are:  
1) To remind you of the (general) linear model, and how we can use it to make models in R  
2) To make some informal model comparisons  
3) To estimate models based on binomially distributed data  

If you would like to read more about a given function, just prepend the function with a question mark, e.g.  
``` {r, eval=FALSE}
?lm
```

REMEMBER: In your report, make sure to include code that can reproduce the answers requested in the exercises below   

## Exercise 1
The general linear model: $Y = X \beta + \epsilon$:  
Do a linear regression, expressing fuel usage as a function of weight using the function __lm__
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data(mtcars)
```
1. extract $\hat{\beta}$, $Y$, $\hat{Y}$, $X$ and $\epsilon$ from __model__ (hint: have a look at the function __model.matrix__)
```{r}
X <- model.matrix(lm(formula=mpg~wt, data=mtcars))

y <- mtcars$mpg

t(X)


t(X) %*% X


solve(t(X) %*% X)


solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X)

bhat <- solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y
bhat

#finding epsilon
yhat <- X %*% bhat

errhat <- y - yhat

errhat # one value for each row

#standard deviation
sigmahat <- sqrt(t(errhat) %*% errhat / 10)
sigmahat # = 5.27
```

    i. create a plot that illustrates $Y$ and $\hat{Y}$ (if you are feeling ambitious, also include $\epsilon$ (hint: you can use the function __arrows__))
```{r}
###########
test <- lm(y ~ X[,2])

plot(test)

# Plotting data
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
    geom_point(colour = "darkred") +
    geom_abline(intercept = b[1], slope = b[2], colour = "darkgreen") +
    geom_abline(intercept = bhat[1], slope = bhat[2], colour = "darkblue")
```

2. estimate $\beta$ for a quadratic model ($y = {\beta}_{2} x^2 + {\beta}_{1} x + {\beta}_{0}$) using ordinary least squares _without_ using __lm__; $\hat{\beta} = {({X}^{T} X)}^{-1} {X}^{T} Y$ (hint: add a third column to $X$ from step 1)
```{r}
X <- rbind(mtcars$wt*wt)

# Adding x^2 to matrix
MatrixB <- cbind(X, c(mtcars$wt*mtcars$wt))
MatrixB

# doing the same thing again...
t(MatrixB)

t(MatrixB) %*% MatrixB

solve(t(MatrixB) %*% MatrixB)

solve(t(MatrixB) %*% MatrixB) %*% t(MatrixB)

bhat <- solve(t(MatrixB) %*% MatrixB) %*% t(MatrixB) %*% y

bhat



```

3. Compare your acquired $\hat{\beta}$ with the output of the corresponding quadratic model created using __lm__ (hint: use the function __I__, see details under help and the sub-section formula operators here: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-formula-tutorial)  
    i. create a plot that illustrates $Y$ and $\hat{Y}$ (if you are feeling ambitious, also include $\epsilon$ (hint: you can use the function __arrows__))

```{r}
# Comparison of beta hat with the quadratic model: 
# Personal comment: The following should give us the same values as the OLS by hand method (matrix multiplication) we've done above. The only reason for doing this a second time is to prove, that R's lm method does the same as the OLS. 
lm(mtcars$mpg ~ MatrixB[,2] + MatrixB[,3])

# Adding
#linear fit
linear<- mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(wt, mpg))+
  geom_point(aes(y = yhat), colour = "orange") +
  geom_point(aes(y = Y), colour = "darkred")

#quadratic fit
quadratic<- mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(wt, mpg))+
  geom_point(aes(y = yhat_quadratic), colour = "blue") +
  geom_point(aes(y = Y), colour = "darkred")

linear/quadratic

summary(model)
summary(model1) #also this one has a better R^2 

```


## Exercise 2
Compare the plotted quadratic fit to the linear fit  

1. which seems better?
2. calculate the sum of squared errors, (show the calculation based on $\epsilon$). Which fit has the lower sum?  
3. now make a cubic fit ($y = {\beta}_{3} x^3 + {\beta}_{2} x^2 + {\beta}_{1} x + {\beta}_{0}$) and compare it to the quadratic fit  
    i. create a plot that illustrates $Y$ and $\hat{Y}$ for both the cubic and the quadratic fits (plot them in the same plot)  
    ii. compare the sum of squared errors  
    iii. what's the estimated value of the "cubic" (${\beta}_3$) parameter? Comment on this!  
4. bonus question: which summary statistic is the fitted value (_Intercept_ or ${\beta}_0$ in $y = {\beta}_0$) below identical to?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
lm(mpg ~ 1, data=mtcars)
```

## Exercise 3
Doing a logistic regression - estimating the probability that a car has automatic transmission (0) or manual transmission (1) based on its weight
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data(mtcars)

summary(logistic.model <- glm(formula= am ~ wt, data=mtcars, family='binomial'))

# Model estimates log odds for level 1
boot::inv.logit(-4.024)

logistic.model$coef


b0 <- logistic.model$coef[1] # intercept
X1 <- logistic.model$coef[2]

X1_range <- seq(from=min(mtcars$wt), to=max(mtcars$wt), by=.01)

a_logits <- b0 + X1*X1_range

a_probs <- exp(a_logits)/(1 + exp(a_logits))

# first you have to get the information into a long dataframe, which is what ggplot likes :)
plot.data <- data.frame(a=boot::inv.logit(-4.024), X1=X1_range)

plot.data <- gather(plot.data, key=group, value=prob, a)

plot(X1_range, a_probs, 
     ylim=c(0,1),
     type="l", 
     lwd=3, 
     lty=2, 
     col="gold", 
     xlab="X1", ylab="P(outcome)", main="Header")

# # # 
ggplot(plot.data, aes(x=X1, y=prob, color=group)) + # asking it to set the color by the variable "group" is what makes it draw three different lines
  geom_line(lwd=2) + 
  labs(x="X1", y="P(outcome)", title="Probability of super important outcome") 


```

Probabilities live on the range $(0, 1)$ - using the so-called logit function as a "link-function" we can map these onto the range $(-\infty, \infty)$, i.e. the real numbers.  
  
What we model in this case is: $Pr(y = 1) = logit^{-1}(X \beta)$, i.e. the probability of a car having manual transmission, given its weight. $X \beta$ is called the linear predictor; compare with $Y = X \beta + \epsilon$ 
It is helpful to define the logit function and its inverse function for the following:  

```{r}
logit <-     function(x) log(x / (1 - x))
inv.logit <- function(x) exp(x) / (1 + exp(x))
```

1. plot the fitted values for __logistic.model__:  
    i. what is the relation between the __linear.predictors__ and the __fitted_values__ of the __logistic.model__ object?
2. plot the logistic function, you've estimated based on your $\hat{\beta}$, (not just the fitted values). Use an _xlim_ of (0, 7)
    i. what's the interpretation of the estimated $\hat{\beta}_0$ (the _Intercept_)
    ii. calculate the estimated probability that the Pontiac Firebird has automatic transmission, given its weight
    iii. bonus question - plot the logistic function and highlight all the cars where we guessed wrongly, if we used the following "quantizer" function:
    
\begin{equation}
  transmission_{guess}=
  \begin{cases}
    1 (manual), & \text{if}\ PR(y = 1) ≥ 0.5 \\
    0 (automatic), & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}    
    
3. plot quadratic fit alongside linear fit  
    i. judging visually, does adding a quadratic term make a difference?
    ii. check the details in the help of the AIC function - which of the models provide the better fit according to the AIC values and the residual deviance respectively?
    iii. in your own words, why might it be good to penalise a model like the quadratic model, we just fitted.
    
# Next time
We are going to looking at extending our models with so called random effects. We need to install the package "lme4" for this. Run the code below or install it from your package manager (Linux)  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("lme4")
```
We can fit a model like this:

```{r}
library(lme4)
mixed.model <- lmer(mpg ~ wt + (1 | cyl), data=mtcars)
```

They result in plots like these:
```{r}
par(font.lab=2, font.axis=2, cex=1.2)
plot(mtcars$wt, fitted.values(mixed.model),
     main='Linear regression with group intercepts (n cylinders)',
    xlab='Weight (lb/1000)', ylab='Miles/(US) gallon',
    pch=3)
```

and this
```{r}
mixed.model <- lmer(mpg ~ wt + (wt | cyl), data=mtcars)
plot(mtcars$wt, fitted.values(mixed.model),
     main='Linear regression with group intercepts and group slopes (n cylinders)',
    xlab='Weight (lb/1000)', ylab='Miles/(US) gallon',
    pch=3)
``` 

but also new warnings like:  

Warning:
In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt\$par, ctrl = control$checkConv,  :
  Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.0121962 (tol = 0.002, component 1)
