# EXERCISE 4 - Download and organise the data from experiment 1
  
1) Put the data from all subjects into a single data frame - note that some of the subjects do not have the _seed_ variable. For these subjects, add this variable and make in _NA_ for all observations. (The _seed_ variable will not be part of the analysis and is not an experimental variable)  

Importing data
```{r}
df <- list.files(path = "data",     # Identify all csv files in folder
                       pattern = "*.csv", full.names = TRUE) %>% 
  lapply(read_csv) %>%                        
  bind_rows
```

  i. Factorise the variables that need factorising
```{r}
# Factorizing cue
df$cue <- as.factor(df$cue)
# Factorizing subject
df$subject <- as.factor(df$subject)
# Factorizing task
df$task <- as.factor(df$task)
# Factorizing obj.resp
df$obj.resp <- as.factor(df$obj.resp)
# Factorizing trial
df$trial <- as.factor(df$trial)
# Factorizing trial.type
df$trial <- as.factor(df$trial.type)
# Factorizing pas
df$pas <- as.factor(df$pas)
```
See assignment 3 for arguments as to which variables should be factorized.

  ii. Remove the practice trials from the dataset (see the _trial.type_ variable)  
```{r}
# Removing practice trials
df <- df %>% 
  subset(df$trial.type == "experiment")
```

  iii. Create a _correct_ variable
```{r}
df$correct <- (ifelse(df$obj.resp == "e" & df$target.type == "even", "1", 
                              ifelse(df$obj.resp == "o" & df$target.type == "odd", "1",
                                     ifelse(df$obj.resp == "o" & df$target.type == "even", "0",
                                            ifelse(df$obj.resp == "e" & df$target.type == "odd", "0", NA)))))
df$correct <- as.numeric(df$correct)
```

  iv. Describe how the _target.contrast_ and _target.frames_ variables differ compared to the data from part 1 of this assignment  
In experiment 1, each participant had the same contrast level on the target cue whereas in experiment 2, the staircase round created an individual contrast level for each participant. This is also what we see in the data.

As for target.frames, in experiment two, all participants saw the target frame for 3 frames, whereas in experiment 1, participants saw the target for 1-6 frames, equally distributed over participants (shown in the following histogram).
```{r}
hist(df$target.frames)
```


# EXERCISE 5 - Use log-likelihood ratio tests to evaluate logistic regression models


1) Do logistic regression - _correct_ as the dependent variable and _target.frames_ as the independent variable. (Make sure that you understand what _target.frames_ encode). Create two models - a complete-pooled model and a partial-pooling model. The partial-pooling model should include a subject-specific intercept.

Creation of models
```{r}
# Partial pooling model
mod1_parPool <- glmer(correct ~ target.frames + (1 | subject), data = df, family = binomial(link=logit))
summary(mod1_parPool)
# Complete pooling nodel
mod1_comPool <- glm(correct ~ target.frames, data = df, family = binomial(link=logit))
summary(mod1_comPool)
```

 i. the likelihood-function for logistic regression is: $L(p)={\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^Np^{y_i}(1-p)^{(1-y_i)}}$ (Remember the probability mass function for the Bernoulli Distribution). Create a function that calculates the likelihood.

Likelihood-function
```{R}
# Creating a likelihood-function
likFunction <- function(model, y){
  fitted <- model$fitted
  y <- y
  return(prod(((fitted^y))*(1 - fitted)^(1-df$correct)))
}
```

  ii. the log-likelihood-function for logistic regression is: $l(p) = {\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^N}[y_i\ln{p}+(1-y_i)\ln{(1-p)}$. Create a function that calculates the log-likelihood  

Log likelihood function
```{R}
# Creating log likelihood function
logLikFunction <- function(model, y){
  fitted <- fitted.values(model)
  y <- y
  return(sum(y * log(fitted)+(1-y) * log(1-fitted)))
}
```

  iii. apply both functions to the pooling model you just created. Make sure that the log-likelihood matches what is returned from the _logLik_ function for the pooled model. Does the likelihood-function return a value that is surprising? Why is the log-likelihood preferable when working with computers with limited precision?
```{r}
# Applying functions to models
likFunction(mod1_comPool, df$correct)
logLikFunction(mod1_comPool, df$correct)

# Comparing my log likelihood function with the logLik function from 'rstanarm package'
print(comp_mods <- tibble(logLik_function=logLik(mod1_comPool),myFunction = logLikFunction(mod1_comPool, df$correct)))
```
As can be seen from the comp_mods dataframe, my log likelihood function returns the same value as the built-in logLik function.

The reason why the likelihood function outputs 0 is, that it calculates the probability of getting the exact same result (with the y's being in the same order etc.) as you just did. The likelihood for this is very, very small. If my computer was more precise it would have calculated the exact value which is in fact >0. This is one of the reasons for why we use the log likelihood: It outputs a bigger number which we can actually display and use for further comparison. 


  iv. now show that the log-likelihood is a little off when applied to the partial pooling model - (the likelihood function is different for the multilevel function
```{r}
print(diff <- tibble(logLik_built_in = logLik(mod1_parPool),logLikelihood_function = logLikFunction(mod1_parPool, df$correct), difference = logLik(mod1_parPool)-logLikFunction(mod1_parPool, df$correct)))
```
The log-likelihood is (10622-10566) 56.5 off. One explanation could be, that my model is not taking into consideration that the model is multilevel. The logLik function probably takes this into account.



2) Use log-likelihood ratio tests to argue for the addition of predictor variables, start from the 

null model, `glm(correct ~ 1, 'binomial', data)`, 
then add subject-level intercepts, 
then add a group-level effect of _target.frames_ and 
finally add subject-level slopes for _target.frames_. 

Also assess whether or not a correlation between the subject-level slopes and the subject-level intercepts should be included.

  i. write a short methods section and a results section where you indicate which model you chose and the statistics relevant for that choice. Include a plot of the estimated group-level function with `xlim=c(0, 8)` that includes the estimated subject-specific functions.
  
## Report

#### Participants
29 participants, 18 women and 11 men, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, provided informed written consent. The sample size of 29 was chosen since it is twice the sample size of previous studies central to this experiment. Doubling the sample size when doing replicate experiments is vital to get reliable results. 

#### Stimuli and procedure
Participants were seated in front of a screen explaining and showing the experiment. The procedure was as follows: Participants were to report if a target number(s) which they saw for a varying amount of time, was either an odd or even number. Before seeing the target stimuli, the participants would get a cue of either 2, 4 or 8 numbers, divided in half even/odd numbers. The target stimuli would always be among the 'cue numbers'. The difficulty of the experiment was controlled by the duration of which the participants saw the target stimuli (1-6 frames) and how vivid the target occurred (its level of contrast). After each trial, participants were asked to rate from 1-4 how visible the target occurred to them, 1 being very unclear and 4 being very clear (inspired by the PAS-scale). 

#### Analysis
In order to predict the rate of success (correct responses), we have built 5 different mixed effects models with random effects and compared them using the log likelihood of each model. This was done with the built-in function of R, anova().
```{r}
# Null model necessary for comparison
null <- glm(correct ~ 1, df, family = binomial(link = logit))
# Model with subject-level intercepts
model_2 <- glmer(correct ~ 1 + (1 | subject), df, family = binomial(link = logit))
# Adding group-level effect of _target.frames_
model_3 <- glmer(correct ~ 1 + target.frames + (1| subject), data = df, family = binomial(link = logit))
# Adding subject-level slopes for _target.frames_
model_4 <- glmer(correct ~ 1 + target.frames + (target.frames | subject), data = df, family = binomial(link = logit))
# Adding a model with a correlation between the subject-level slopes and the subject-level intercepts
model_5 <- glmer(correct ~ 1 + target.frames + (target.frames || subject), data = df, family = binomial(link = logit))

# Comparing models
anova(model_2,null, model_3, model_4,model_5)
```

#### Results and discussion
Results from the anova test indicated that correctness explained by target.frame with random intercept for subject and random slope by target.frame was the best performing model, having the lowest log likelihood compared to the other models. 

In creating model 4 we used R (R Core Team, 2019) and glmer to perform a linear mixed effects analysis of the relationship between correct/incorrect answers and how many frames the target was shown for. As fixed effects, we entered the number of frames the participants saw the stimuli. As random effects, we had intercepts for subject, as well as by-subject random slopes for the effect of the number of frames the participant saw.
The model was built using the following syntax:

    correct ~ target.frames + (target.frames | subject)
    
Correct/incorrect has been found to significantly be modulated by the number of frames stimuli was shown, $\beta_0 = -1.09 (SE = 0.059, p < .001) $ & $\beta_1 = 0.83 (SE = 0.044, p < .001)$.

Furthermore we have made a plot showing the estimated group-level (red lines) function with and which also includes the estimated subject-specific (blue lines) functions. This plot is showing that the plot might not be the best fit for subject 24. When comparing the mean accuracy of subject 24 (0.56) with the mean accuracy of all participants (0.77), it seems as if subject 24 did a really bad job. Even when there was target variable was shown for 6 frames, subject 24 had an accuracy of only 0.69 against 0.966 of all the other participants. A one-sample t-test confirms that the difference in accuracy between subject 24 and the rest is a statistical significant with a theoretical value of .5:  $t(873) = 4.026, p < .001$.

  ii. also include in the results section whether the fit didn't look good for any of the subjects. If so, identify those subjects in the report, and judge (no statistical test) whether their performance (accuracy) differed from that of the other subjects. Was their performance better than chance? (Use a statistical test this time) (50 %)
```{r}
df_24 <- df %>% 
  filter(subject == "024")

tibble(Accuracy_overall = mean(df$correct), Accuracy_subject_24 = mean(df_24$correct))

df_24_6_frames <- df_24 %>% 
  filter(target.frames == 6)

df_6_frames <- df %>% 
  filter(target.frames == 6)

tibble(Accuracy_when_6_frames_overall = mean(df_6_frames$correct), Accuracy_when_6_frames_subject_24 = mean(df_24_6_frames$correct))

t.test(x = (df_24$correct), mu = 0.5)
```

```{r}
# Plot showing the estimated group-level (red lines) function with and which also includes the estimated subject-specific (blue lines) functions.
plotdata <- df %>% 
  select(-subject) # create data without subject to override facet_wrap in plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = target.frames, y = as.numeric(as.character(correct))))+
  geom_line(aes(target.frames, fitted(model_4)), color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(data = plotdata, method = "glm", se = FALSE, method.args = list(family = "binomial"), color = "red", size = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(.~subject)+
  xlim(min = 0, max = 8)+
  labs(y = "correct") + 
  theme_bw()
```

3) Now add _pas_ to the group-level effects, also add the interaction between _pas_ and _target.frames_ and check whether a log-likelihood ratio test justifies this  

  i. plot the estimated group-level functions over `xlim=c(0, 8)` for each of the four PAS-ratings - add this plot to your report (see: 5.2.i) and add a description of your chosen model. Describe how _pas_ affects accuracy together with target duration if at all. Also comment on the estimated functions' behaviour at target.frame=0 - is that behaviour reasonable?
```{r}
model_6 <- glmer(correct ~ target.frames + pas + (target.frames | subject), data = df, family = binomial(link = logit))

model_7 <- glmer(correct ~ target.frames*pas + (target.frames | subject), data = df, family = binomial(link = logit))

# Comparing
anova(model_5,null,model_2, model_3, model_4,model_6, model_7)

# Plotting group level effects (interaction effects)
interactions::interact_plot(model = model_7, pred = target.frames, modx = pas)
```
The log likelihood ratio test justifies adding the interaction between pas and target frames. Adding the interaction between pas rating and target frames increased the log likelihood by -9742 compared to model 4's -10448.8.


#### Continuation of report
The best performing model (selected based on the results from the likelihood ratio test) is model 7, which takes the following parameters:
    
    correct ~ target.frames*pas + (target.frames | subject)
    
The model tells us that the interaction effect has an impact on the accuracy which makes it meaningful to include in the model. From the plot we can tell, that if participants rated pas = 1, then the number of frames participant saw the target is not going to change accuracy very much. On the contrary, if participants rated pas = 2 or 3, then number of frames the target was shown for is affecting accuracy a lot. If participants rated pas = 4, then target frames is less likely to influence accuracy.


# EXERCISE 6 - Test linear hypotheses

In this section we are going to test different hypotheses. We assume that we have already proved that more objective evidence (longer duration of stimuli) is sufficient to increase accuracy in and of itself and that more subjective evidence (higher PAS ratings) is also sufficient to increase accuracy in and of itself.

We want to test a hypothesis for each of the three neighbouring differences in PAS, i.e. the difference between 2 and 1, the difference between 3 and 2 and the difference between 4 and 3. More specifically, we want to test the hypothesis that accuracy increases faster with objective evidence if subjective evidence is higher at the same time, i.e. we want to test for an interaction.  

1) Fit a model based on the following formula: `correct ~ pas * target.frames + (target.frames | subject))`
```{r}
model_8 <- glmer(correct ~ pas * target.frames + (target.frames | subject), data = df, family = binomial(link = logit))
```

  i. First, use `summary` (yes, you are allowed to!) to argue that accuracy increases faster with objective evidence for PAS 2 than for PAS 1. 
```{r}
summary(model_8)

boot::inv.logit(0.11481)
boot::inv.logit(0.44718)
```

The summary of the model shows that accuracy increases with objective evidence - in this case the number of target frames - for pas2 than for pas1: the interaction effect for pas2 and target.frames (pas2:target.frames) is significant and positive (0.447).

  
2) `summary` won't allow you to test whether accuracy increases faster with objective evidence for PAS 3 than for PAS 2 (unless you use `relevel`, which you are not allowed to in this exercise). Instead, we'll be using the function `glht` from the `multcomp` package
    i. To redo the test in 6.1.i, you can create a _contrast_ vector. This vector will have the length of the number of estimated group-level effects and any specific contrast you can think of can be specified using this. For redoing the test from 6.1.i, the code snippet below will do
```{r}
# Loading library
p_load(multcomp)

## testing whether PAS 2 is different from PAS 1
contrast.vector <- matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0), nrow=1)
gh_1 <- glht(model_8, contrast.vector)
print(summary(gh_1))
invlogit(coef(summary(gh_1))) # finding increase in percentile
```

as another example, we could also test whether there is a difference in intercepts between PAS 2 and PAS 3
```{r}
contrast.vector <- matrix(c(0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), nrow=1)
gh_2 <- glht(model_8, contrast.vector)
print(summary(gh_2))
```
There is no significant effect of a difference in intercepts between pas2 and pas3.


Testing if accuracy performance increases faster for pas3 than pas2
```{r}
contrast.vector <- matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0), nrow=1)
gh_3 <- glht(model_8, contrast.vector)
print(summary(gh_3))
```

According to a hypothesis test, accuracy increases significantly faster with objective evidence (target.frames) for pas3 than pas2, β = 0.301, z = 6.528, p < .05.

Testing if accuracy performance increases faster for pas4 than pas3
```{r}
contrast.vector <- matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1), nrow=1)
gh_4 <- glht(model_8, contrast.vector)
print(summary(gh_4))
```
According to another hypothesis test, accuracy does not increase significantly faster with objective evidence (target.frames) for pas3 than pas2, β = 0.01, z = 0.142, p > .05

3) Finally, test that whether the difference between PAS 2 and 1 (tested in 6.1.i) is greater than the difference between PAS 4 and 3 (tested in 6.2.iii)
*?????????????????*

# EXERCISE 7 - Estimate psychometric functions for the Perceptual Awareness Scale and evaluate them  

We saw in 5.3 that the estimated functions went below chance at a target duration of 0 frames (0 ms). This does not seem reasonable, so we will be trying a different approach for fitting here.  
We will fit the following function that results in a sigmoid, $f(x) = a + \frac {b - a} {1 + e^{\frac {c-x} {d}}}$  
It has four parameters: _a_, which can be interpreted as the minimum accuracy level, _b_, which can be interpreted as the maximum accuracy level, _c_, which can be interpreted as the so-called inflexion point, i.e. where the derivative of the sigmoid reaches its maximum and _d_, which can be interpreted as the steepness at the inflexion point. (When _d_ goes towards infinity, the slope goes towards a straight line, and when it goes towards 0, the slope goes towards a step function).  
  
We can define a function of a residual sum of squares as below

```{r, eval=FALSE}
RSS <- function(dataset, par) 
  {
    ## "dataset" should be a data.frame containing the variables x (target.frames)
    ## and y (correct)
    
    ## "par" are our four parameters (a numeric vector) 
    a = par[1] 
    b = par[2] 
    c = par[3] 
    d = par[4]
  
    x <- dataset$x
    y <- dataset$y
    y.hat <- a + ((b-a)/(1+exp(1)^((c-x)/d))) 
    RSS <- sum((y - y.hat)^2)
    return(RSS) 
}

```

1) Now, we will fit the sigmoid for the four PAS ratings for Subject 7
    i. use the function `optim`. It returns a list that among other things contains the four estimated parameters. You should set the following arguments:  
    `par`: you can set _c_ and _d_ as 1. Find good choices for _a_ and _b_ yourself (and argue why they are appropriate)  
    `fn`: which function to minimise? Residual sum of squares.
    `data`: the data frame with _x_, _target.frames_, and _y_, _correct_ in it  
    `method`: 'L-BFGS-B'  
    `lower`: lower bounds for the four parameters, (the lowest value they can take), you can set _c_ and _d_ as `-Inf`. Find good choices for _a_ and _b_ yourself (and argue why they are appropriate)  
    `upper`: upper bounds for the four parameters, (the highest value they can take) can set _c_ and _d_ as `Inf`. Find good choices for _a_ and _b_ yourself (and argue why they are appropriate)
```{r}
df_partcipant007 <- df %>% 
  dplyr::filter(subject == "007") %>% # For some reason, the dplyr commands only works if you specifically point to their package.
  dplyr::select(target.frames, correct) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(x = target.frames, y = correct)

par <- c(0.5, 0.8, 1, 1)

optim_participant007 <- optim(data = df_partcipant007, fn = RSS, par = par, method = 'L-BFGS-B', lower = c(0, 0, -Inf, -Inf), upper = c(1, 1, Inf, Inf))

print(optim_participant007[1])
```
Argument for par = (0.5, 0.8, 1, 1):
a = 0.5, since this is the worst accuracy level; outcome being purely chance. b = 0.9 since 90% accuracy is fair (depending on the situation of course).

The parameter estimates given my chosen estimates were: $ a = 0.38, b = 0.98, c = 2.23, d = 0.63 $

The optim function is suggesting some quite differences parameters than I did. It is strange that it is suggesting lowest accuracy level of 38% percent, and 98% as upper bound of accuracy seems also a bit too high (Personal note to Lau: My understanding of the optim function is relatively limited...).


  ii. Plot the fits for the PAS ratings on a single plot (for subject 7) `xlim=c(0, 8)`
```{R}
sigmoid_007 <- function(x) 
  {
  optim_participant007$par[1] + ((optim_participant007$par[2]-optim_participant007$par[1])/(1+exp(1)^((optim_participant007$par[3]-x)/optim_participant007$par[4])))
}


ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = c(0:6), y = sigmoid_007(0:6))) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = c(0:6), y = sigmoid_007(0:6)), se = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Estimated fits for PAS ratings",
       x = "Target.Frames",
       y = "Estimated PAS ratings using sigmoid-function") +
  theme_bw()
```

  iii. Create a similar plot for the PAS ratings on a single plot (for subject 7), but this time based on the model from 6.1 `xlim=c(0, 8)`
Due to only having 1 subject (subject 7), it is not possible to run the model from exercise 6.1 with random effects (target.frames|subject). Thus, the random effects are removed from the model, in order to run it for subject 7; (correct~pas*target.frames). 

```{r, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)}

## Exercise 7.2 
##### 2) Finally, estimate the parameters for all subjects and each of their four PAS ratings. Then plot the estimated function at the group-level by taking the mean for each of the four parameters, _a_, _b_, _c_ and _d_ across subjects. A function should be estimated for each PAS-rating (it should look somewhat similar to Fig. 3 from the article:  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2019.03.007)


### i. Comparison and comments
##### Compare with the figure you made in 5.3.ii and comment on the differences between the fits - mention some advantages and disadvantages of both.

Once again, I have absolutely no clue..
